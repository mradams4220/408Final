# 408Final

My plan for this final for 408 is to create a choose-your-own adventure game in Java because I think it correlates with the DFAs we learned in class this semester.

I will have a character object in my code so that you can have health and damage variables. There will also be enemies and other characters you meet throughout your adventure
